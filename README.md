# Starter code for react-native with TYPESCRIPT
The entry point is index.js all the application code is in the src directory.
I have followed the container view pattern here.
The concept is that the all the bussinness logic will be in the container which will also be responsible for rendering views which is present in the view files also the reusable componnet will be in the component folder

For navigation I have used [react-navigation](https://reactnavigation.org)
